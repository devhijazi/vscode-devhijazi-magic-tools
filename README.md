### Om Theme Dracula

### Live Server

This extension sets up a local web server so that you can see the changes made in real-time without having to reload. Itâ€™s a must-have for web development.

### Prettier

This extension keeps your code formatted and uniform throughout.

### Eslint

The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or npm install -g eslint for a global install.

### vscode-proto3

Protobuf 3 support for Visual Studio Code

### EditorConfig

This plugin attempts to override user/workspace settings with settings found in .editorconfig files. No additional or vscode-specific files are required. As with any EditorConfig plugin, if root=true is not specified, EditorConfig will continue to look for an .editorconfig file outside of the project.

### HTML CSS Support

Here are a few key features this extension adds:

- Class attribute completion.
- Id attribute completion.
- Scans workspace folder for CSS and SCSS files.
- Supports remote css files.
